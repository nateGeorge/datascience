I grew up in Elkhorn, Nebraska, earned a B.S. in Chemical Engineering from Colorado School of Mines, then completed my PhD in Chemical Engineering from UCSB (studying phosphors used in solid-state LED lighting).  After that, I worked for a CIGS solar cell factory for a year in the San Francisco Bay Area.  I left that job, and spent some time entrepreneuring internet of things products for home and farm automation, including water-cooled LED lighting.  After that I went through more education for computer vision (PyImageSearch Gurus course), machine learning (Udacity NanoDegree), and data science (Galvanize in Denver, CO).  Currently I'm an assistant professor teaching data science at Regis University in Denver, CO.
